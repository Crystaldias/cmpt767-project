## Questions Focused

### Policy Responses and Their Impact:

Analyze whether specific policy interventions are associated with changes in key COVID-19 metrics.
This question focuses on understanding how specific government policy interventions have influenced key COVID-19 metrics. It involves analyzing the data to identify whether there is a correlation between the implementation of certain policies (e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates, travel restrictions) and changes in COVID-19 metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. This analysis can provide insights into which policies have been most effective in curbing the pandemic's impact.
